# Selenium-Learning
This repository is created to document my learning journey in Selenium automation with Java. Here, I practice different concepts like locators, browser automation, handling web elements, writing test scripts, and building end-to-end workflows. The goal of this repo is to improve my QA automation skills and track my progress in Selenium.
